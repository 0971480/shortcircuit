CRC WRCCDC Competition 2024

This is the competition container for CIS students to serve as a roadmap and toolkit for WRCCDC's competition environment. Using SSH and applying their cybersecurity skills outside of the classroom, this serves as a guide as to how to practice their skills they have learned in information security, cryptography, network analysis and end-point protection. This is just practice as we gain experience in cybercompetitions.
